In my program we created using switch case for getting input from the user 
1.Enter a name: This operation allows the user to enter a new name in the list.
2.Search for a name: This operation allows the user to search for a specific name in the list.
3.Remove a name: This operation allows the user to remove a specific name from the list.
4.Show all names: This operation displays all the names in the list.
0.Exit: This operation exits the program.

when we enter the number we can access and we can give input of the program we can remove the name from the input using 4 in the switch case statement in the program
