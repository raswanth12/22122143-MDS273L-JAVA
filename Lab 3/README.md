Create a java program that performs the following operation:
The program should collect an integer array from the user
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items
Find the Mean Value
Find the Median Value
Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.

In this program we are collecting the array elements
And we are giving array as an input to find the (mean/median/mode) for the given set of array as the input.
in this code we are giving three things (mean/median/mode)
can be check for the given set of array we can give n mumber of array in the program
